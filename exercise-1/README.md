# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll build a (very) simple twitter-like app using React and Firebase. You'll create an authentication interface, as well as a chat interface:

![completed twitter interface](imgs/complete.png)

Because this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you should begin by forking/cloning this repository, then installing necessary packages:

```bash
# Make sure you're inside the exercise directory
cd exercise-1

# Install packages in package.json
npm install

# Start server
npm start
```

Then follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.
